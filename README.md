## Supported Images / Hardware

This app is tested with a variety of ISOs from various Linux distributions e.g. Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, Raspbian, etc. It should work with all disk images which can be flashed directly through `dd`.

Hardware regularly tested against include SD cards, USB flash drives, and external USB hard drives.

‚ö†Ô∏è Support for CD/DVD drives is untested. Flashing to a CD/DVD using this tool may result in a non-functional boot media. If you would like to hack on this, please open an issue.

‚ö†Ô∏è Windows ISOs are currently not supported, since they require special handling. Support is being tracked in [issue #2](https://github.com/retrixe/imprint/issues/2).
